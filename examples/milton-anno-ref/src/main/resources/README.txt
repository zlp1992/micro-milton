GETTING A LICENSE

Milton requires a signed license file to enabled dav level 2 and above features,
including locking, caldav and carddav.

This project includes these files in the src/main/resources folder
    - milton.license.properties - plain text description of who is licensed
    - milton.license.sig - signature file for the license properties

The included license files are time limited. They will usually be replaced
after each time limited period, but if not please obtain license files from the
milton website - http://milton.io/products/milton2-trial/

Or contact the author - http://milton.io/contactus

Thanks,
Brad
