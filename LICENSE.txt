Please see license statements in each module.

Most modules are Apache2 licensed, however Milton Server Enterprise (milton-server-ent) is 
made available by default on the Affero GPL, and commercial licenses are available.

The milton reference implementation is a derivative work of milton-server-ent so
is necessarily on the same license terms.
